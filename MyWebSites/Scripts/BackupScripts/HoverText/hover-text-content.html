    <p><strong>Cyber Security</strong> is a key component across all my projects, from vulnerability prevention to securing custom databases. This section covers critical concepts for protecting digital systems, including:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Known Vulnerabilities:</strong> Recognizing common software weaknesses and their impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Cryptography & Cryptanalysis:</strong> Applying encryption and decryption for data security.</li>
        <li><strong>Password Security:</strong> Implementing secure password management techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>SQL Injection & Buffer Overflow:</strong> Preventing exploits like SQL injection and buffer overflows.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I also contributed to the <strong>National Exercise Panoptis 2018</strong>, handling real-world cyber defense tasks, such as:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Linux Forensics:</strong> Investigating and addressing security breaches on Linux servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Forensics:</strong> Monitoring traffic to detect unauthorized activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My skills in <strong>Linux Scripting</strong>, <strong>SSH</strong>, and <strong>Telnet</strong> have been crucial for securing <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> setups and integrating <strong>IoT</strong> projects like the <strong>Sense Hat</strong>, focusing on secure remote access via SSH.</p>
